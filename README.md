# Well, hello there 👋🏻 

Nice to see you here! I'm Alexandre, 29 years old, and I've recently embarked on an exciting journey into web development. After several years in a different field, I decided to train myself and finally pursue my passion for **coding** ! 👨🏻‍💻
I’m eager to explore new ways to create applications, websites, and anything that can be both useful and entertaining.

I’ve always been fascinated by video games—especially how they’re made and how specific functions are coded to create skills for the main character, for instance.

You can find more information about me below or on my  [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexandre-leote/) ! Feel free to take a look. 😉
I hope to hear from you soon!

<!-- ## Hi there 👋

I won't say the line, I promise... Maybe I will... 

Anyway, I'm Alexandre, I'm 29 years old and fairly new to the world of coding. I always wanted to become a full time developer and as of today I have started my training in order to be a real asset in the future.
I am learning several languages at the moment but for now I am at ease with some of them below.

![alexbanner_Plan de travail](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/633f7c80-0a26-4357-a980-72298aba9bf9)
I live in France, was born in Alsace, Mulhouse and now I live in Strasbourg for the moment.
During my freetime I tend to spend it between visiting my family, seeing my friends but also playing board games as well as video games.
If you give me the possibility to talk about RPGs, I might spend a lot of time talking about Final Fantasy... Up to you !
