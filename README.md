Well, hello there 👋🏻 

Nice to see you here, I'm Alexandre. I'm 29 years old and I have recently taken a new step into the web development's epic journey.
After several years working in another field, I have decided to train myself and finally get into what I always wanted to do : **coding** ! 👨🏻‍💻
I am looking for new ways of coding applications, websites and anything that could be either useful or entertaining.

I have always been interested in video games, how they were made, the way people coded this specific function in order to make a skill for the main character for instance.

You will find some more information about myself below or on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexandre-leote/) ! Have a look. 😉
And hope to read from you soon !

<!-- ## Hi there 👋

I won't say the line, I promise... Maybe I will... 

Anyway, I'm Alexandre, I'm 29 years old and fairly new to the world of coding. I always wanted to become a full time developer and as of today I have started my training in order to be a real asset in the future.
I am learning several languages at the moment but for now I am at ease with some of them below.

I live in France, was born in Alsace, Mulhouse and now I live in Strasbourg for the moment.
During my freetime I tend to spend it between visiting my family, seeing my friends but also playing board games as well as video games.
If you give me the possibility to talk about RPGs, I might spend a lot of time talking about Final Fantasy... Up to you !
