## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I won't say the line, I promise... Maybe I will... 

Anyway, I'm Alexandre, I'm 29 years old and fairly new to the world of coding. I always wanted to become a full time developer and as of today I have started my training in order to be a real asset in the future.
I am learning several languages at the moment but for now I am at ease with some of them below.

I plan on doing a better README page with some of my work and translate this in English and French (as the latter is my mothertongue).
During my freetime I tend to spend it between visiting my family, seeing my friends but also playing board games as well as video games.
If you give me the possibility to talk about RPGs, I might spend a lot of time talking about Final Fantasy... Up to you !
