Well hello there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Alexandre, I'm 29 years old and fairly new to the world of coding. I always wanted to become a full time developer and as of today I have started my training in order to be a real asset in the future.
I am learning several languages at the moment but for now I am at ease with some of them above.

You will find some more information about myself here or on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexandre-leote/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} !





<!-- ## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I won't say the line, I promise... Maybe I will... 

Anyway, I'm Alexandre, I'm 29 years old and fairly new to the world of coding. I always wanted to become a full time developer and as of today I have started my training in order to be a real asset in the future.
I am learning several languages at the moment but for now I am at ease with some of them below.

</p>

I live in France, was born in Alsace, Mulhouse and now I live in Strasbourg for the moment.
During my freetime I tend to spend it between visiting my family, seeing my friends but also playing board games as well as video games.
If you give me the possibility to talk about RPGs, I might spend a lot of time talking about Final Fantasy... Up to you !
